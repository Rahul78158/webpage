                <p class="text2">I have done my internship at pyramid it solutions on automation of web using cloud. Here primarily we create an ui and push the code in the github, which is a central repository and it facilitates version control. We used aws cloud to create the instances (virtual servers) and installed github, maven in one of the instances. We clone the ui code into the github</p>
                <p class="text2">To host websites we need web servers. Web applications can be developed using different languages like Java, Dot Net, PHP, Python, Ruby on Rails We got different web servers in the market. Apache Tomcat, Oracle Weblogic, IBM Websphere, Pramati App server, Jboss, Sun Glassfish Etc.. Microsoft IIS (Internet Information Service) - to deploy dotnet web applications Nginx, Apache Server AWS account is created primarily for creation of the required instances. The softwares used in this project are GitHub, Maven, Tomcat, Jenkins. For the convenience install github and maven software in one of the instances and the tomcat in the other instance. Aim of the project is to automate the Github changes automatically to the web page. In order to do so, we use jenkins software which can be installed in the same instance of the github. Jenkins Pipeline code is directed to the github repository. Jenkinsfile which in turn can be committed to a project's source control repository. When the Jenkins software is built, it can directly run the instance whenever it finds the change code change in the github repository</p>
